# Exa Search Comparison

A thing that compares Exa's search API with traditional search because AI Agents will search the web a million times more than humans ever did.

## Running this thing

1. Install the stuff:
```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

2. Set your Exa API key (get one from [exa.ai](https://exa.ai) if you don't have it):
```bash
export EXA_API_KEY=your_key_here
```

3. Run it:
```bash
python app.py
```

4. Open http://localhost:5000 and search for things.

## That's it

No really, that's all there is to it. What were you expecting, a 47-page setup guide?
